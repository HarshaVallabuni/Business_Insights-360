## Business Problem
AtliQ Hardware expanded globally but faced challenges in making **data-driven decisions**. Key business questions were spread across departments, and past decisions based on intuition led to losses (e.g., store expansion in the US).  
The company needed a centralized **interactive BI solution** to analyze performance and drive insights across departments.

## Tools & Tech Stack
- **SQL** (data extraction from MySQL database)  
- **Power BI Desktop** (dashboard development)  
- **Excel** (data preprocessing)  
- **DAX Language & DAX Studio** (measures, optimization, performance tuning)

---

## Data & Modeling
- Imported datasets from **MySQL database** into Power BI  
- Applied **Snowflake schema modeling** for structured relationships  
- Created **calculated columns** and **measures** using DAX  
- Implemented **data validation** techniques to ensure accuracy  

---

## Dashboard Design & Features
- Multi-view dashboard with navigation across:
  - **Finance View** â†’ Profit & Loss, revenue, costs, margins  
  - **Sales View** â†’ Customer & product sales performance  
  - **Marketing View** â†’ Segment profitability, campaign analysis  
  - **Supply Chain View** â†’ Forecast accuracy, error trends, risk profiles  
  - **Executive View** â†’ Consolidated KPIs for top management  

- **Key Power BI techniques applied**:
  - Dynamic titles & slicers  
  - Conditional formatting with icons and colors  
  - Page navigation using buttons & bookmarks  
  - KPI cards for quick insights  
  - Report publishing to Power BI Service
